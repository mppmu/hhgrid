# hhgrid

gghh 2-loop virtual amplitude interfered with 1-loop amplitude.

Returns V_fin using the conventions specified in Eq(2.5) of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09252.pdf
 
As required by `POWHEG` the born factor of alpha_s^2 is included in the grids `Virt_EFT.grid` and `Virt_full.grid`. 
We evaluate alpha_s at a scale of `m_HH/2` using `LHAPDF` with the `PDF4LHC15_nlo_100` set.
We also provide the grids `Virt_EFT_noas.grid` and `Virt_full_noas.grid` which omit the overall factor of alpha_s^2 (but include all other constants e.g. 2*pi).
The grid includes the symmetry factor of 1/2 and a factor of 1/256 for spin/colour averaging.

Physical parameters are set to:
* `G_F = 1.1663787e-5 GeV^(-2)` (Fermi constant)
* `m_T = 173 GeV` (top-quark mass)
* `m_H = 125 GeV` (Higgs boson mass)
* `w_T = 0` (top-quark width)
* `w_H = 0` (Higgs boson width)

## Installation

Pre-requisites:
* `python` (tested for 3.10.9)
* `pyyaml` (tested for 6.0)
* `numpy` (tested for 1.24.2)
* `scipy` (tested for 1.10.1)

Assuming you have `python` you can check for the availability of `yaml`, `numpy` and `scipy` with the commands:
```shell
python3 -c "import yaml"
python3 -c "import numpy"
python3 -c "import scipy"
```
If no output is given from these commands then the packages are available.
 
To use the Python/C API you need to build the `hhgrid` library. 
 To do this run the usual `autotools` commands (replacing `<build-directory>` with the path you would like to install the library to):
```shell
autoreconf -i
./configure --prefix=<build-directory>
make
make check
make install
```
If you do not have a fortran compiler installed and do not want to use the grid from a fortran program, pass the `--disable-fortran` flag to the configure script.
 We strongly advise to run the `make check` command. This will call the grid for a few selected points and validate that the correct result is produced. 
 
You should now add the directory containing the `hhgrid-config` script to your `PATH` and the `python` data directory to your `PYTHONPATH`. This may be accomplished by adding the following lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` (replacing `<build-directory>` with the path you installed the library to):
```shell
export PATH="<build-directory>/bin":$PATH
export PYTHONPATH="<build-directory>/share/hhgrid":$PYTHONPATH
```
 
The directory containing the `libhhgrid` shared library should be added to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Mac OS):
```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<build-directory>/lib":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
or (some 64 bit systems)
```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<build-directory>/lib64":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
or (Mac OS)
```shell
 export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="<build-directory>/lib":$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Python/C API Usage

Here we demonstrate how to access the grid with one of the example programs `c_example.c`, `cpp_example.cpp` or `f90_example.f90` in the `examples` directory,
this will check that everything is set up correctly and show the steps required to call the grid from your own program.

The `hhgrid-config` script helps to obtain the correct flags for compiling and linking the program.

If you would like to use the C interface you can compile the example program `examples/c_example.c`:
```shell
cc examples/c_example.c -o c_example.x `hhgrid-config --cflags --libs`
```

If you would like to use the C++ interface you can compile the test program `examples/cpp_example.cpp`:
```shell
c++ examples/cpp_example.cpp -o cpp_example.x `hhgrid-config --cflags --libs`
```

If you would like to use the fortran interface you can compile the test program `examples/f90_example.f90`:
```shell
gfortran examples/f90_example.f90 -o f90_example.x `hhgrid-config --cflags --libs`
```

To launch the C, C++ and fortran test program enter:
```shell
./c_example.x
./cpp_example.x
./f90_example.x
```
The example programs will call the grid for a single phase-space point. They demonstate as simply as possible how to use the library within your own code 

## Using the grid with your own code
 
The `hhgrid` library exposes the following functions:

* ```void python_initialize(void)```
  A thin wrapper around the Python C API function `Py_Initialize()`, used at the beginning of your program to start the `python` interpreter.
* ```void python_decref(PyObject* grid)```
  A thin wrapper around the Python C API function `Py_DECREF(grid)` used to decrement the `python` interpreter reference count by 1 (required for garbage collection).
* ```void python_finalize(void)```
  A thin wrapper around the Python C API function `Py_Finalize()` used at the end of your program to terminate the `python` interpreter.
* ```void python_printinfo(void)```
  Prints the python paths and versions being used by the library (useful for debugging).
* ```PyObject* grid_initialize(const char* grid_name)```
  Searches `PYTHONPATH` for a grid with a file name matching the input `grid_name`, if found it initialises this grid else terminates your program.
* ```double grid_virt(PyObject* grid, double s, double t)```
  Uses the `grid` object to evaluate the phase-space point specified by the Mandelstam invariants `s`,`t`.
 
Usually, the easiest way to understand how to use the grid with your own code is to look at the relevant example in the `examples` directory.

Broadly the following steps should be taken to use the grid:
* include the `hhgrid.h` as in the examples (C or C++).
* Call `python_initialize()`, `python_printinfo()` once at the beginning of your program.
* Construct a grid object using `PyObject* pGrid = grid_initialize(grid_name);` at the beginning of your program. 
* Call `grid_virt(pGrid, s, t)` for each phase-space point you wish to evaluate, here `pGrid` is an instance of the grid and `s`,`t` are the Mandelstam invariants.
* Call `python_decref(pGrid)` for each instance of the grid and `python_finalize()` once at the end of your program.

When linking your code against `hhgrid` we advise to use the `hhgrid-config --cflags --libs` command to ensure that your program is compiled with the correct `python` headers and libraries.

## Grid files and validation points
 
The grid files contain 4 columns `beta_s`, `cos(theta)`, `V_fin` and `V_fin Error`.
 
Here:
* `beta_s = \sqrt{1-4*mH^2/s}`
* `cos(theta) = (t-u)/(s*beta_s)`, where `u= 2 mH^2 - s -t`
 
For ease of validation we give here a few values from the `Virt_EFT.grid` along with the corresponding Mandelstam `s` and `t` and the value that is returned by `grid.py` (note: since `grid.py` internally bins results the output is not perfect for each phase space point).

For validation the corresponding Born HTL cross-section values are:
 
| s | t | B |

For the Pure HEFT (not re-weighted by the Born) at NLO for hadronic centre-of-mass energy ``\sqrt{s} = 14 TeV`` with the central (dynamic) scale value (``muR=muF=M_{hh}/2``) we obtain for the total cross-section:

`\sigma_tot = 0.31937346E-01 +/- 0.46742589E-05 pb` (analytic)

`\sigma_tot = 0.31640084E-01 +/- 0.49620079E-05 pb` (grid)

In the `examples/validation` folder we also provide example distributions for `m_HH` (invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair), `p_T^H` (transverse momentum of a random Higgs boson) and `y_HH` (rapidity of the Higgs pair system). 
The `heft`/`full` files contain the NLO result at 14 TeV in the HEFT/Full theory respectively. 
The 1st column of the file is the bin centre, the 2nd column is the bin value and the 3rd column is the error on the bin.
